The remaining Welsh, Caledonians, Brigantes and Brythons are readying for war with the Roman alliance! <br> <br>Romans. <br>The Romans start with no income. Claudius does not want to spend any more money. The Romans must capture territory quickly to gain income and rebuild. Remember this is a business venture for the Romans. <br> <br>Warning! Legionary cohorts and war elephants cannot be replaced. Protect them with cannon fodder such as light auxilia. <br>
